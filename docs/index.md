# Introduction

Welcome to the Salt framework!

Salt is a general-purpose framework for training **multi-modal**, **multi-task** models for high energy physics.

Salt supports arbitrary combinations of tasks including object classification and regression, and set-to-set reconstruction via edge classification and segmentation.
Salt was developed for state-of-the art jet flavour tagging algorithms such as [GN1](https://ftag-docs.docs.cern.ch/algorithms/taggers/GN1/) and [GN2](https://ftag-docs.docs.cern.ch/algorithms/taggers/GN2/), but can be applied much more widely, as seen [below](#current-usage).

!!! example "The code is hosted on the CERN GitLab: [https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/salt](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/salt)"

### Features

- Built on [Pytorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/).
- Support for multiple YAML-configurable [input modalities][salt.models.InitNet] and [output tasks][task-heads].
- ONNX export support to use trained models in C++ environments like [Athena](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/).
- Easily extensible: you can implement your own custom dataloaders and models.
- Documented and tested.

### Getting Started

Below are some helpful links to get you started:

## Statement of Need

High energy physics research increasingly requires sophisticated machine learning tools to address complex data analysis challenges, for example identifying jets from bottom and charm quarks through their distinctive decay signatures in particle detectors. Salt meets this need by providing a versatile and high-performance machine learning framework that supports various tasks including object classification, regression, and set-to-set reconstruction, enabling physicists to effectively analyse complex particle collision signatures such as charged particle trajectories, decay vertices, and jets.
